# Dither Service

The **Dither Service** utilizes **event-sourcing data** to deterministically rebuild application state. This is achieved by processing events streamed directly from cosmos-based chains, specifically **AtomOne**.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Usage)

To quickly spin up the entire Dither Service and its components, use the provided Docker Compose file:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

You will need to start the frontend service on its own.
